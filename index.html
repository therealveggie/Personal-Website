								<p>
									As a part of my first work term in health canada, I had the oppurtunity to create a website for the screening and review tool (SRT) that we are developing. It's main function is to serve as a place for users of the SRT where they can find out how to use the tool, and who to contact.

							<div class = "proj_desc">
								<p>
									A friend and I had noticed that even though it is quite trivial to compare scehdules between users that use the same platform (such as outlook, or google calendar), it is a bit of a pain to do so if you use different platforms. So at Ottahacks 2018, we made a website that would require the user to just enter the emails and passwords of the accounts. Then the program will automatically determine what free time is available during that week.

									This was my first time dealing with both Django and OAuth, it was quite a challenge. But I really enjoyed it.

							<div class = "proj_desc">
								<p>
									A rhythm game inspired by Tap Tap Revenge and StepMania. On top of the standard rhythm game we also added in a creator mode, where a user can create their own songs, and their own beatmaps to play with. This was built in Java for our grade 12 computer science summative.

								<p>
									A website that shows users what stores in the area accept WatCard as a form of payment. As freshmen at the University of Waterloo, there wasn't much awarness in terms of what ways we can use our WatCard, so a few friends and I made this for the PortalHack competion

								<p>
									Using 2 Onion Omega boards we used light to wirelessly transmit messages. By flashing LEDs at photoresitors using morse code we were able to transmit messages as long as the LED and Photoresitor were in close proximity. This was made for the ECE 150 final.
